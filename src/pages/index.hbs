    <p>Afiax design Protocol is a design system for The Oort Cloud Computing ltd and afiax websites. It establishes a common design language, provides reusable coded components, and outlines high level guidelines for content and accessibility.</p>

    <p>Afiax design Protocol is still an evolving project. Currently it’s used primarily by the Oort cloud Marketing Websites team as the front-end for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a>. The long term goal is to provide a robust, unified design system that anyone at the Oort cloud can use to build an on-brand website.</p>

  <p>Benefits of a design system:</p>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>Improved User Experience: Scaled, consistent design patterns and content practices provide users with a familiar experience that allows for less time spent on re-learning interactions, finding pages that serve user needs, and abandoning pages that don’t.</li>
    <li>Efficiency: With a library of design components ready to employ and clear guidelines for creators, we spend more time on creation that serves our users and less time on “reinventing the wheel”.</li>
    <li>Clarity: With clearly documented guidelines and governance for design and content creation, we spend less time negotiating the guidelines to create clarity for ourselves and more time creating designs and content that clearly serves our users.</li>
  </ul>
